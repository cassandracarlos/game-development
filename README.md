# Building Blocks of Games

"Building Blocks of Games: Design and Development Essentials" Certainly! If your GitHub repository is more of a personal space for my works in progress on the Modular Game Design (MGD) book and isn't intended for collaboration or usage by others, I can simplify the README accordingly. Here's a revised template:

# Project Title

## Description

Briefly describe that this repository serves as my personal workspace for collecting notes, chapters, and assets for the Modular Game Design book.

## Table of Contents
1. [Project Status](#project-status)
2. [About the Book](#about-the-book)
3. [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
4. [Contact](#contact)

## Project Status

Provide a short update on my progress and any notable milestones.

## About the Book

Include a brief section about the book, outlining its purpose, goals, and any other relevant information.

## Folder Structure

Explain the organization of my repository, detailing how you've structured folders for different chapters, notes, or assets.

```
/Modular-Game-Design-Book
|-- /Chapters
|   |-- Chapter1.md
|   |-- Chapter2.md
|   |-- ...
|-- /Assets
|   |-- images
|   |-- diagrams
|-- /Notes
|   |-- notes.md
|   |-- ...
```

## Contact

Mention how others can get in touch with me if they have questions or if I'm open to discussions about my work.

# Tips:
* Personal tone: Keep the README personal and geared towards my own use. I don't need to include instructions or details for others.
* Minimalist Approach: Since it's for personal use, keep the README simple and focused on what's essential for my workflow.
* Update as Needed: Update the README whenever I make significant progress or changes to my book.
